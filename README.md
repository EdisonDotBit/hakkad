CyberShield: Web-Based Security Training for IT Students at Rizal Technological University

The "CyberShield: Web-Based Security Training for IT Students at Rizal Technological University" project addresses the critical need for modern cybersecurity education. Traditional methods have been found wanting as a result of this innovation being applied by CyberShield specifically for IT students. In order to better equip students against real-life threats, this project blends theoretical and hands-on cyber security training.

CyberShield enhances cybersecurity education at RTU by improving result tracking, accessibility, readiness, and cost-effectiveness. This project aims to make cyber security a part of the schoolâ€™s culture by inculcating a proactive attitude that emphasizes awareness and safety. Additionally, through quizzes and gamification features on an interactive user-friendly web platform, CyberShield wants to encourage student engagement, enhance learning experience and offer them necessary skills they require in cyber security.
